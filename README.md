# Philosophy Club

My friend and I have for years been reading philosophy and meeting weekly to discuss what we read.
We realized though that it's difficult to hang on to insights, questions, and ponderances as time goes by.
I built this blog for us to record our thoughts.

[Deployed on Heroku](https://philosophy-club.herokuapp.com/), but we haven't written anything yet : )
